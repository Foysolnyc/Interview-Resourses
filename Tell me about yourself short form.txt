As you see on my  Resume , I have been working a QA 7+ years.

I have done both Manual and automation.

Over the years, I worked with different indestries.

In different project I worked with Selenium WebDriver,Selenium Grid, Java, Cucumber , Maven, Github, Ghenkins , ALM ,Jira , Rally, Jmeter, SQL and API

In most of my project, we  followed agile methodology, While I worked with agile, I had to perticipate in different meeting.

I worked very closely with developer and Business Aynalist. I developed test cases , test scenarios and test data by using Gherkins and BDD approch.

I love working as a QA. because it is a dynamic field and every day I have chance to learn something new.

As a QA Automation engineer, Sometimes I had to create my own framwork, sometimes I worked with their existing framwork.

As a senior QA , Sometimes I played leadership role, I  trained Junior QA about new tools and technologies.

I'm team player, hard worker and highly technical.
 
If needed I can work independently with minimum supervision.

That's all about me Briefly . 

If you have any specific question about this tools and technologies,
 
You could go ahead and ask me, I'll answer them.

Thank you.
