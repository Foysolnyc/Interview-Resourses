QA Process:

1. Our process start with story grooming meeting, where we gather all the customers requirements and user stories. We analyze them,
then we follow in a plan as to which enviroment we can development and test. 

2. Then We go to the sprint planning where we discuss about the time frame. Most of the time, we follow 2 weeks sprint cycles depending on how big the project is. 

3. Then we go to the sprint review meeting and finalize the sprint.

4. Then we go the sprint release stage, where we discuss about the incremental release. 



Every morning my BA assigns work to my email and I run the test cases manually (functional test) and write it down on excel sheet and send it back to him/her.

Whenever my BA say its valid test cases, then I upload them to ALM and run it manually. If all my test cases run manually on ALM, then its fine. 

If any of test cases fail, I create a bug on ALM and assign it to the developer. 
AFter developer fixes the bug then I run it again and make sure the bug is fixed and all my test cases passed.

Then I start develop BDD framework.
